  # Introduction
  The Incus team is pleased to announce the release of Incus 0.6!

  This second release of 2024 features a number of improvements, both large and small.

  It comes with a completely new storage driver for cluster users, import/export support for storage buckets, a number of improvements for OVN users, support for new container kernel features, quite a few improvements to the migration tooling and more!

  As usual, you can try it for yourself online: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/

  Enjoy!

  # New features
  ## Clustered LVM storage driver
  A new storage driver named `lvmcluster` has been added.

  As the name implies, this is for clustered use of the LVM storage driver.
  This relies on `llvmlockd` and a lock manager like `sanlock` to provide concurrent access to a shared storage device across a cluster.

  This is aimed at anyone who wants to run an Incus cluster and use a shared storage device like a FiberChannel SAN, iSCSI export, NVMEoF/NVMEoTCP disk, ...

  With the ability of having the same storage available on all servers comes support for much faster live migrations, server evacuations and the ability to automatically recover should a server suddenly die.

  ## Storage bucket backup and import
  It is now possible to backup a full storage bucket and later re-import back into Incus.

  ## Listing image across all projects
  Just as it's possible to list instances across all projects using the `--all-projects`, it's now possible to do the same but for images.

      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus image list --all-projects
      +---------+-------+--------------+--------+------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
      | PROJECT | ALIAS | FINGERPRINT  | PUBLIC |               DESCRIPTION                | ARCHITECTURE |      TYPE       |   SIZE    |          UPLOAD DATE          |
      +---------+-------+--------------+--------+------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
      | default |       | 256f59a72af5 | no     | Ubuntu jammy amd64 (20240222_07:42)      | x86_64       | VIRTUAL-MACHINE | 267.19MiB | Feb 23, 2024 at 12:27am (UTC) |
      +---------+-------+--------------+--------+------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+

      +---------+-------+--------------+--------+------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+

  Over the API, this is done by passing `?all-projects=true`.

  ## binfmt_misc in unprivileged containers
  Linux 6.7 added support for mounting of `binfmt_misc` inside of unprivileged containers.

  Incus 0.6 will detect kernels that support this feature and when they do, it will no longer bind-mount `binfmt_misc` from the host system but instead allow it to be mounted from within the container.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus launch images:ubuntu/22.04 foo
      Launching foo
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus exec foo bash
      root@foo:~# uname -a
      Linux foo 6.7.4-zabbly+ #debian12 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Feb  5 23:37:46 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
      root@foo:~# mount -t binfmt_misc binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/
      root@foo:~# ls -lh /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/
      total 0
      --w------- 1 root root 0 Feb 23 03:46 register
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Feb 23 03:46 status

  The `binfmt_misc` filesystem is used to define custom binary formats for emulation.
  It's most notably used by qemu-user-static as a way to run binaries of other architectures.

  ## Control over shared block storage volumes
  A new `security.shared` volume storage option has been introduced to control whether a custom block volume should be allowed to be used by multiple instances.

  It is now required to set that configuration key prior to adding a custom block volume to a profile or add it directly to multiple virtual machines.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus config device add lvm01 shared disk pool=default source=shared-lvm io.bus=nvme
      Device shared added to lvm01
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus config device add lvm02 shared disk pool=default source=shared-lvm io.bus=nvme
      Error: Failed add validation for device "shared": Cannot add un-shared custom storage block volume to more than one instance
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus storage volume set default shared-lvm security.shared=true
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus config device add lvm02 shared disk pool=default source=shared-lvm io.bus=nvme
      Device shared added to lvm02
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus config device add lvm03 shared disk pool=default source=shared-lvm io.bus=nvme
      Device shared added to lvm03
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus start lvm01 lvm02 lvm03

  ## OVN logical router name in network info
  To make it easier to see what's going on within OVN, `incus network info` now gives you the name of the logical router for a particular network.

      root@abydos:~# incus network info default
      Name: default
      MAC address: 00:16:3e:38:dd:28
      MTU: 1500
      State: up
      Type: broadcast
      
      IP addresses:
        inet	10.180.103.1/24 (link)
        inet6	2602:fc62:a:1004::1/64 (link)
      
      Network usage:
        Bytes received: 0B
        Bytes sent: 0B
        Packets received: 0
        Packets sent: 0
      
      OVN:
        Chassis: abydos
        Logical router: incus-net6-lr

  ## File ownership and permissions in image templates
  Template files can now have a `uid`, `gid` and `mode` set on them.
  This can be particularly useful if a template is meant to be an executable shell script.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus config metadata show foo
      architecture: amd64
      creation_date: 1708588077
      expiry_date: 1711180077
      properties:
        architecture: amd64
        description: Ubuntu jammy amd64 (20240222_07:42)
        name: ubuntu-jammy-amd64-default-20240222_07:42
        os: ubuntu
        release: jammy
        serial: "20240222_07:42"
        variant: default
      templates:
        /etc/hostname:
          when:
          - create
          - copy
          create_only: false
          template: hostname.tpl
          properties: {}
        /etc/hosts:
          when:
          - create
          - copy
          create_only: false
          template: hosts.tpl
          properties: {}
        /root/hello.sh:
          when:
          - start
          create_only: false
          template: hello.tpl
          properties: {}
          uid: "1000"
          gid: "2000"
          mode: "0755"
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus config template show foo hello.tpl
      #!/bin/sh
      echo "Hello world!"
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus start foo
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus exec foo bash
      root@foo:~# ls -lh /root/hello.sh
      -rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu 2000 30 Feb 23 04:07 /root/hello.sh
      root@foo:~# /root/hello.sh
      Hello world!

  ## Encrypted EC client certificate keys
  For those interacting with remote Incus servers, you may not know that it's possible to protect your Incus private key with a password.

  Up until now, this was only possible for RSA keys, but with Incus 0.6, we're now adding support for EC keys too. That's particularly relevant as EC keys have been the default for a while now.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authentication/#encrypting-local-keys

  Worth noting that if using this feature, you'll likely also want to make use of the recently introduced ["keepalive mode"](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/remotes/#remote-keepalive) as this will then significantly reduce the number of password prompts you'll get while using Incus.

  ## lxd-to-incus improvements
  Lastly, `lxd-to-incus` saw a number of improvements:

  - Support for Void Linux
  - Detection of the `boot.debug_edk2` configuration key
  - Handling of OVN SSL database connections
  - Automatic clearing of the simplestreams cache during migration
